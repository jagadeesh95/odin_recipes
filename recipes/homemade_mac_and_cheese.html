    <p>
        This mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and comforting. 
        It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stovetop, 
        starting with a <i>roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan,</i>  
        resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles.
